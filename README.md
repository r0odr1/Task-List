## Overview :writing_hand:
This application will help you keep track of what you need, list tasks, and delete them, but the important thing is that if you close the application, your information will not be lost

### Installation :gear:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/r0odr1/Task-List.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd list-items-react
 ```
3. Install the dependencies:
```shell
 npm install
  ```
4. Start the application: 
```shell
 npm run dev
  ```
### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:

The main challenge of the application was to create it in React along with Typescript, but additionally, store the information without losing it even if the page is reloaded

What you can do:

* Add as much information as you want.
* Delete tasks.
